# Initial Research and Analysis

- Always, before making any changes, research and analyze the reported error or bug in detail.

- Investigate all fields and components that are directly related to the problem description.

# Scope of Changes

- Only make changes that directly address the error/bug described.

- Do not add, remove or modify functions, code snippets or features that are not directly linked to the problem in question.

# Respect User Instructions

- Only perform what was clearly requested, without introducing additional changes or restructuring not explicitly requested.

- If indirect changes are needed to solve the problem, these should be discussed or confirmed with the user before being made.

# Validation and Preservation

- After the analysis, implement a minimal and precise correction, fully preserving the other features that are not related to the reported error.
